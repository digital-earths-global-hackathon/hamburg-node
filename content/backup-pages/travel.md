#### Arriving by Plane
To get to the city center after your arrival at Hamburg Airport head to the SBahn station.
It is indicated by overhead signs showing a white 'S' inside a green circle. From there either take
**S1** or **S11** in the direction of **Blankenese** or **Wedel**. Both SBahn lines will take
you to the central station (in German: Hauptbahnhof), from there you find connections to all other SBahn lines, UBahn lines and many buslines for onward travel.

**Alternate Airports**
- Bremen (BRE) - travel time to Hamburg Central Station up to 1h50min
- Hannover (HAJ) - travel time up to 2h30min
- Berlin (BER) - travel time up to 3h30min


#### Arriving by Train
If you choose to travel to Hamburg by train you will arrive centrally at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. An alternative train station would be Hamburg Dammtor that is quite close to the hackathon location. But please make sure that your train will stop there. Not all trains do.
