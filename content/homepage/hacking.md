To minimze technical issues and spend as most time as possible for analysing data, please check out the [starting point]({{% ref howtotech %}}) and read through the documentation carefully.

During the Hackathon, you can either build a science team, join an existing one, explore in loose collaborations with others or work on your own.

Check out our **[Science and Hacking Plan](https://digital-earths-global-hackathon.github.io/hk25/)** for more details.
