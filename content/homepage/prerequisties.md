During the Hackathon climate data from km-scale simulations with the Unified Model and other models will be provided in a [**Healpix format**](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/Processing/healpix/index.html) at different zoom levels. Jupyter Notebooks will be provided to explain the basics of the data handling. First examples can already be found on [**easy.gems**](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/Processing/healpix/healpix_starter.html). Participants can then develop their own Jupyter Notebooks or python scripts to analyze and plot the data.

Participants are expected to have basic knowledge of:

- Linux terminal
- Python, including Matplotlib, Numpy, Xarray
- Concepts of data visualization
- Handling of global 2D and 3D data in Climate science or similar fields
