##### Transport passes for the week

Tickets for the Hamburg transport network (HVV) can be bought [online](https://hvv.de/en/onlineshop), in the
[HVV-App](https://hvv.de/en/service/hvv-apps) or at the ticket machines found at almost every station.

The network is segmented into rings from A to F. If you don't plan to travel far outside the city, purchasing
regular tickets for zones A and B will certainly suffice.

For the duration of the Hackathon a [weekly 24/7 ticket](https://shop.hvv.de/product/564/show) will be your cheapest option to travel around Hamburg.
