The Hamburg node is hosted by the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.

Central Hackathon location: [**Bundesstr.53, 20146 Hamburg**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2qrCJZtc5N3sxVGZ7)


#### How to get here
##### By Plane

To get to the city center after your arrival at Hamburg Airport head to the S-Bahn station. It is indicated by overhead signs showing a white ‘S’ inside a green circle. From there either take the S1 in the direction of *Blankenese* or *Wedel*. The S1 will take you to the central station (in German: Hauptbahnhof), from there you find connections to all other S-Bahn lines, U-Bahn lines and many buslines for onward travel.

**Alternate Airports**

Bremen (BRE) - travel time to Hamburg Central Station up to 1h50min by train
Hannover (HAJ) - travel time up to 2h30min by train
Berlin (BER) - travel time up to 3h30min by train


##### By Train

If you choose to travel to Hamburg by train you will arrive centrally at **Hamburg Hauptbahnhof**. An alternative train station would be **Hamburg Dammtor** that is quite close to the hackathon location. But please make sure that your train will stop there. Not all trains do.


##### How to get to MPI-M

If you travel by U-Bahn, the closest station is **Schlump** (lines U2 and U3).
The nearest bus stations are Zoologisches Museum (line X35), Bundesstrasse (lines 4, 15), or Grindelhof (lines 4, 5).

#### Transport passes for the week

Tickets for the Hamburg transport network (HVV) can be bought [online](https://hvv.de/en/onlineshop), in the [HVV-App](https://hvv.de/en/service/hvv-apps) or at the ticket machines found at almost every station.

The network is segmented into rings from A to F. If you don’t plan to travel far outside the city, purchasing regular tickets for zones A and B will certainly suffice.

For the duration of the Hackathon a [weekly 24/7 ticket](https://shop.hvv.de/product/564/show) will be your cheapest option to travel around Hamburg.
