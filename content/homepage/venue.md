##### Directions from the subway station "Schlump"

When making your way out of the station keep
an eye out for a large brutalist tower, the **Geomatikum**. From the station head then left
along the street **Beim Schlump** nearing the tower. Upon arriving at an intersection with a Shell petrol
station down to your left and a building under construction to your right, turn right across the street and
follow the road for 2 minutes until you spot a turquoise coloured glass building. You have found the
Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology. Entrances are located on both sides of the building.
