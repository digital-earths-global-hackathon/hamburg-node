To help your search for accommodation in Hamburg, you can find a list of [**hotel options**]({{% ref hotellist %}}).
For easier orientation, the list of hotels can also be viewed on **[Google Maps](https://www.google.de/maps/search/Hotels/@53.5668599,9.9604056,15.66z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)**.

**Please Note!** The weekend before the dates of our hackathon Hamburg celebrate its [836th port anniversary](https://www.hamburg.com/visitors/port-anniversary). Hotel prices may stay above their regular level. **To avoid overly high prices, book as soon as possible with the option for flexible cancellation!**
